I selected my index.html page which allows user to select criteria to find a tutor
Prompt 1: Make this page more user-friendly

To make the HTML code more user-friendly, you can improve its readability and structure, add some labels and placeholders for form inputs, and use some additional HTML elements for better presentation. 

This did not provide the answer I wanted, I already have labels. I want to make the interface more user friendly.

Prompt 2: How can the user interface be improved?

Chat GPT response: Improving the user interface involves not only modifying the HTML code but also considering the visual design and layout. Here are some ways to enhance the user interface of your web page:

I found the following important


1. Card Design:
Add box shadows and subtle borders to make the cards stand out.
Use hover effects to indicate interactivity when the user hovers over the cards.

2. Form Design:
Group related form fields using fieldsets or div containers to create visual separation.
Add a title or header for the form section, such as "Contact Us" or "Get in Touch."
Consider using radio buttons, dropdowns, or checkboxes for input fields where applicable, rather than just text inputs.
Provide informative error messages and validation feedback if the form is submitted with incorrect or missing information.

3. Responsive Design:
Ensure that your web page is responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes. Use media queries to adapt the layout for smaller screens.


4. Feedback and Confirmation:
Provide feedback to the user after form submission, such as a success message or a confirmation screen.
Add loading indicators if the form submission takes some time.

5. Accessibility:
Make sure your web page is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Use semantic HTML elements, alt text for images, and ARIA attributes if necessary.

6. User Experience:
Optimize the performance of your web page to ensure fast loading times.
Test your website on various browsers to ensure compatibility.
Keep the user experience in mind, focusing on making the content and interactions as smooth as possible.




Solution/ feature to implement:
1. Consider using radio buttons, dropdowns, or checkboxes for input fields where applicable, rather than just text inputs.
2. Add an appropriate title to form, and brief instructions

These solutions were implemented but there are other features from the list that I think are quite important that if not already implemented, can be refined as project continues.
